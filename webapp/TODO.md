- add some debugging options here so that when we're paging through, we can
  stop or just load the first page so we can trace what's happening.

- TODO:
    - now merge the thinking behind index.html and index-singlepage.html and

        - create a singlepage viewer object
        - manually call render with the singlepage settings but use my
          per page handling logic from before
        - set it up so that I don't always have to destroy
